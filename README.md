##Fusion.Collection

The Fusion.Collection package is a small utility library aimed at helping aggregate similar items
into a managed collection.  Collections can be loose or strict as needs dictate.  The library 
provides generic collections that can be extended along with some default implementations to use
where fitting.

###Features

- Managed index values that auto-update as the collection grows and shrinks.
- Create generic collections that allow multiple types of values or restrict to a specific type of
  object or scalar value.
- Collections are traversable so they may be used with `foreach` loops.
